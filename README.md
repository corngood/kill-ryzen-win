- install some version of visual studio with C and C# compilers (Tested with VS
  2017)
- start VS command prompt, e.g. "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2017"

```
kill-ryzen-win>build.cmd
...
kill-ryzen-win>run.cmd
bzip2.c
bzip2.c
bzip2.c
...
[CTRL-C]
```

- I've seen internal compiler errors when pressing ctrl-c, so don't consider
  those a failure.
